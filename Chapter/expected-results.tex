	\section{Main Contributions of the Thesis}\label{cap:contributions}
	\thispagestyle{empty}

	The following contributions are expected with the development of the proposed work:

	\begin{enumerate}
    \item Analysis of the potential of Internet Exchange Points to be used as vantage points and improve the peering interconnection, as well as its strengths and limitations;

    \item Formalization of a methodology to improve the mapping of peering interconnections by exploiting the characteristics of the Internet Traffic Exchange Points, introducing new datasets and scalability;

    \item Development of a prototype of the proposed methodology, allowing its applicability in practical situations and the development of new researches.
    \end{enumerate}

	%It is also expected that during the development of this work there will be the participation of master and scientific initiation students, performing works related to the doctoral thesis proposed in this plan. It is then considered that participation in the training of these students' knowledge as one of the possible contributions.
