\chapter{Expected Results}\label{cap:expected-results}
\thispagestyle{empty}

	In this chapter, we present the expected results of the Ph.D. First, we describe the main contributions of the proposed work in Section~\ref{sec:contributions}. Finally, in Section~\ref{sec:publications}, we present some of the leading journals (Table~\ref{tbl:journals}) in which the results obtained during the doctorate can be published and some of the main conferences related to the research areas involved in this plan (Table~\ref{tbl:conferences}).

	\section{Main Contributions of the Thesis}\label{sec:contributions}
	\thispagestyle{empty}

	The following contributions are expected with the development of the proposed work:

	\begin{enumerate}
    \item Analysis of the potential of Internet Exchange Points to be used as scalable vantage points to map and generate geolocation inferences, as well as its strengths and limitations;

    \item Formalization of a methodology to improve the mapping of peering interconnections by exploiting the characteristics of the Internet Exchange Points, introducing new datasets and scalability;

    \item Development of a prototype of the proposed methodology, allowing its applicability in practical situations and the development of new researches.
    \end{enumerate}

	It is also expected that during the development of this work there will be the participation of master and scientific initiation students, performing work related to the doctoral thesis proposed in this plan. The participation in the training of these student's knowledge is then considered as one of the possible contributions.

	\section{Publications}
	\label{sec:publications}

	The development of Ph.D. activities will generate results which will be used as a basis for the writing of articles for journals and congresses. Table~\ref{tbl:journals} presents some of the main journals in which the results obtained during the doctorate can be published, while Table~\ref{tbl:conferences} presents some of the leading conferences of the research areas involved in this plan.
